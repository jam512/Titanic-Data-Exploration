In this assignment, you will perform feature engineering and logistic regression on Titanic dataset, 
where you will create new columns, transform variables into numerical values, and handle missing values! 
This is done to find whether the passenger had survived or not. 
Our main aim here is to find the accuracy score of our model.

Link to Titanic dataset:

Perform the following: 

1) Import the required libraries (sklearn, pandas, numpy). Import datasets. 
Concatenate the datasets. Display first 5 rows.

2) Remove NaN values from the column ‘Survived’. (Hint: use .dropna()) 

3) Create a new column 'Has_Cabin' that tells you whether passengers had a cabin or not. 
(Hint: use .isnull() method in “Cabin” column)

4) Create a new column “Title”, which will contain the titles of the passengers such as Mr., Mrs., etc. There should be five titles: Mr, Mrs, Master, Miss, and Special. 
(Hint: Use regular expression to replace the titles)

 5) Impute the missing values using .fillna() method.

 6) Create two new columns “Categorical_age” and “Categorical_fare”, where you will put people that are within a certain range of age or fare in the same bin. 
You can do this by using the pandas function qcut() to bin your numerical data. 
(This is done because there is a range of ages and fares, so there might be fluctuations in those numbers that don't reflect patterns in the data, which might be noise.)

7) Drop columns Cabin, Name, Passengerid, Ticket, Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch.

8) Transform all variables into numeric ones using get_dummies(). 

9) Now we need training set and testing set. Use train_test_split() to split your dataset. 
X(Features) will be the dataset values without the column “Survived” and y(Targets) will be your “Survived” column values. 

10) Use logistic regression by passing your X_train and y_train.

11) Print the accuracy score.
